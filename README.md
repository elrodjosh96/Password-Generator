## Description
This password generator will prompt the user to specify the length of the password, and gives the options for using lowercase/uppercase letters, number or specials characters. The password length must be a minimum of 8 characters and no longer than 128 characters. This was a simply build using basic HTML and CSS components. The functionality was built using JavaScript. I hope you will find this app useful in creating a new randomized secure password!
